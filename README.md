# Patterns_Implementation

Just short and basic implementation of popular OOP design patterns i know. This is just like cheat sheet for me. I wanted to create something small, but pretty helpful for times when I want to refresh my memory on any pattern i already knew.
And i simply wanted to write something in C# .NET 8.

This repository will contain the 23 most popular OOP patterns. Whose short descriptions will most likely be in Russian, since I am making this repository purely for myself.
